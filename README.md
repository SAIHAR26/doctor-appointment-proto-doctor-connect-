🎯 Purpose of This Prototype

Since hackathons require fast, functional prototypes, we focused on:

Designing clean interfaces

Creating smooth user journeys

Using LocalStorage instead of real backend

Demonstrating logic: login → search → profile → booking → dashboard

Showcasing our understanding of appointment workflows

Perfect for hackathon presentations where UI + flow matter more than full backend.

📦 How to Run

No installation needed.
Just open login.html in any browser → choose a role → demo begins.
